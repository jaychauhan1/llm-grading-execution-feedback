# Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Problem
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time.

## Examples
- Input: `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]` → Output: `4` (sequence: `[1,2,3,4]`)
- Input: `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]` → Output: `9`

## Constraints
- `0 <= len(nums) <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Function Signature
Implement:

```python
def longestConsecutive(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    ...



RUBRIC:


STUDENT CODE:
def longestConsecutive(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums = sorted(set(nums))  # likely correct output, but O(n log n)
    best = 1
    cur = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == nums[i - 1] + 1:
            cur += 1
        else:
            cur = 1
        best = max(best, cur)
    return best



Execution summary:
passed = 27
failed = 0
runtime_ms = 0

Failure traces: none (all tests passed)

Return the required JSON.
