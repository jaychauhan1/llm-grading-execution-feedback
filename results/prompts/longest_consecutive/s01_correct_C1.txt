# Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Problem
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time.

## Examples
- Input: `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]` → Output: `4` (sequence: `[1,2,3,4]`)
- Input: `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]` → Output: `9`

## Constraints
- `0 <= len(nums) <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Function Signature
Implement:

```python
def longestConsecutive(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    ...



RUBRIC:


STUDENT CODE:
def longestConsecutive(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    s = set(nums)
    best = 0
    for x in s:
        if (x - 1) not in s:
            y = x
            while y in s:
                y += 1
            best = max(best, y - x)
    return best



Return the required JSON.
