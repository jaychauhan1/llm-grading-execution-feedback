"\nYou are grading a programming submission.\n\n# Longest Consecutive Sequence\n\n## Problem\nGiven an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time.\n\n## Examples\n- Input: `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]` \u2192 Output: `4` (sequence: `[1,2,3,4]`)\n- Input: `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]` \u2192 Output: `9`\n\n## Constraints\n- `0 <= len(nums) <= 10^5`\n- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`\n\n## Function Signature\nImplement:\n\n```python\ndef longestConsecutive(nums: list[int]) -> int:\n    ...\n\n\n\nRUBRIC:\n\n\nSTUDENT CODE:\ndef longestConsecutive(nums: list[int]) -> int:\n    s = set(nums)\n    best = 0\n    for x in nums:  # starts counting from every element (slower; duplicates)\n        length = 0\n        while (x + length) in s:\n            length += 1\n        best = max(best, length)\n    return best\n\n\n\nReturn the required JSON.\n"
