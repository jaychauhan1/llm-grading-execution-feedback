# Experiment Plan

## Dataset
For each of the 5 problems:
- Collect multiple submissions with known labels
- Run deterministic tests to generate execution evidence

## LLM Grading
Each submission will be graded under:
C1, C2, C3, C4.

We repeat grading multiple times to measure consistency.

## Outputs
Raw outputs → results/raw  
Aggregated metrics → results/tables
